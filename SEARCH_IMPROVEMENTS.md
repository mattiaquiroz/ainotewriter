# Search Engine Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Result Counts for All Search Engines

**Problem**: The search log showed "found results" without specifying how many results were found, particularly for Google searches.

**Solution**: 
- Added `_extract_result_count()` function that counts "Result N:" patterns in search results
- Modified the main search loop to display specific result counts for each search engine
- Now shows: `‚úÖ Google (yagooglesearch) successful - found 5 results` instead of just `‚úÖ Google (yagooglesearch) successful - found results`

### 2. Enhanced Search Query Generation

**Problem**: Search queries were too short (truncated to 200 characters) and didn't extract enough meaningful context.

**Solution**:
- Created `_build_enhanced_search_query()` function that:
  - Extracts quoted text (direct claims)
  - Identifies names and entities (capitalized terms)
  - Finds years and dates
  - Detects significant numbers
  - Identifies important keywords (bill, law, election, etc.)
  - Combines main text (up to 500 chars) with key terms
  - Allows up to 800 characters total (up from 200)

### 3. Improved Comprehensive Search Query Building

**Problem**: The `_build_comprehensive_search_query()` function was too basic and didn't create sufficiently comprehensive searches.

**Solution**:
- Increased query length limit from 150 to 300 characters
- Added intelligent search operators:
  - Automatically adds "2024 OR 2025" for recent context
  - Adds "news OR recent OR latest" for current information
  - Adds "official OR announcement OR statement" for political/legal terms
- Uses OR operators to create comprehensive coverage
- Allows up to 400 characters for the final enhanced query

## Example Improvements

### Before:
```
üîç Starting multi-engine search for: .@ladygaga's "Abracadabra" has...
üîç Trying Google (yagooglesearch)...
‚ö†Ô∏è Google (yagooglesearch) returned no results
```

### After:
```
üîç Starting multi-engine search for: .@ladygaga's "Abracadabra" has outstreamed every single track from Cowboy Carter Lady Gaga Abracadabra 2024 OR 2025 news OR recent OR latest...
üîç Trying Google (yagooglesearch)...
‚úÖ Google (yagooglesearch) successful - found 8 results
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `src/note_writer/llm_util.py`: Main search functionality improvements

### New Functions Added:
- `_extract_result_count()`: Counts results in search result strings
- `_build_enhanced_search_query()`: Extracts key terms and builds comprehensive queries

### Functions Modified:
- `get_gemini_search_response()`: Now uses enhanced query building
- `_build_comprehensive_search_query()`: Improved with better search operators

## Benefits

1. **Better Visibility**: Users can now see exactly how many results each search engine found
2. **More Comprehensive Searches**: Longer, more detailed queries with extracted key terms
3. **Better Context**: Automatic addition of year and news context for recent events
4. **Improved Success Rate**: More comprehensive queries should find more relevant results
