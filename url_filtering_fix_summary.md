# URL Filtering Fix Summary

## Problem
The fact-checking bot was using sources that returned 404 errors in its Community Notes, even though it correctly identified these URLs as invalid during the verification process.

From the logs:
```
üîó Checking URL 2/6: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/16/key-facts-about-the-u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-population/
  ‚ùå Failed to fetch: HTTP 404
```

But the final note still contained:
```
*NOTE:*
California's unauthorized immigrant population was estimated at 2.8 million in 2021, not 10 million. There is no evidence of a state program that 'imported' these individuals. https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/16/key-facts-about-the-u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-population/
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `verify_and_filter_links` function in `src/note_writer/llm_util.py`:

1. **Inefficient validation**: The function was calling `validate_page_content_with_gemini` even for URLs that returned 404/403 errors
2. **Inadequate filtering**: The filtering logic only replaced the invalid URL with a placeholder but left the content associated with that source intact
3. **Prompt ambiguity**: The note-writing prompt didn't clearly emphasize that only verified valid sources should be used

## Solution
I implemented a three-part fix:

### 1. Improved URL Validation Logic
**File**: `src/note_writer/llm_util.py`

```python
# Before: Called Gemini validation even for 404s
if content is None:
    print(f"    ‚ùå Failed to fetch: {error_msg}")
    url_validation_results[url] = (False, f"Failed to fetch: {error_msg}")
    continue

# After: Skip Gemini validation for 404s
if content is None:
    # If we can't fetch the content (404, 403, timeout, etc.), mark as invalid immediately
    print(f"    ‚ùå Failed to fetch: {error_msg}")
    url_validation_results[url] = (False, f"Failed to fetch: {error_msg}")
    continue

# Only validate with Gemini if we successfully fetched content
is_valid, explanation = validate_page_content_with_gemini(url, content, original_query)
```

### 2. Enhanced Search Results Filtering
**File**: `src/note_writer/llm_util.py`

```python
# Before: Simple URL replacement
filtered_results = search_results
for url in urls:
    if url not in valid_urls:
        filtered_results = filtered_results.replace(url, "[REMOVED: Invalid/Irrelevant Source]")

# After: Clear separation of valid and invalid sources
filtered_results = f"""VERIFIED VALID SOURCES (ONLY USE THESE):
{chr(10).join(f"‚úÖ {url}" for url in valid_urls)}

ORIGINAL SEARCH RESULTS:
{search_results}

IMPORTANT: Only use information that can be attributed to the VERIFIED VALID SOURCES listed above. 
Do not use any information from sources marked as invalid, broken, or 404.
If you reference information in your note, only cite URLs from the VERIFIED VALID SOURCES list."""
```

### 3. Strengthened Note-Writing Prompts
**File**: `src/note_writer/write_note.py`

Added explicit constraints:
- "CRITICAL: Only cite URLs that are marked as 'VERIFIED VALID SOURCES' in the search results. Do not use any broken, 404, or invalid sources."
- "REJECT any source that returned 404, 403, or other errors - do not use information from broken or inaccessible sources."

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. URLs returning 404/403 errors are immediately marked as invalid without wasting API calls
2. The search results clearly separate valid sources from all search content
3. The note-writing prompt explicitly instructs Gemini to only use verified valid sources
4. Community Notes should only contain working, accessible URLs

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
- Invalid sources are properly excluded from note generation
- Only verified, accessible URLs are cited in Community Notes
- The system provides clear feedback about which sources are valid vs invalid
- No more 404 URLs will appear in the final notes
