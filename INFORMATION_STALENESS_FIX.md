# Fix for Information Staleness Issues

## Problem Identified

The fact-checking system was generating outdated information, as demonstrated by the Zohran Mamdani case where it incorrectly stated he wasn't running for NYC mayor when he had actually won the Democratic primary in June 2025.

## Root Causes

1. **Knowledge Cutoff Limitations**: Gemini 2.5 Flash has a knowledge cutoff that predates recent events
2. **Insufficient Web Search Prioritization**: System only used web search as a supplement for certain keywords
3. **Outdated Source Dependencies**: System relied primarily on model's built-in knowledge instead of real-time information
4. **Weak Link Verification**: Only 1 out of 5 sources were valid, and they weren't current enough

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Web Search Strategy (`search_web_for_recent_info`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Multiple Search Queries**: Now runs 4 different search strategies instead of 1:
  - Recent events: `"{query} 2024 OR 2025"`
  - Official sources: `"{query} site:gov OR site:edu OR site:org"`
  - News coverage: `"{query} news 2024 2025"`
  - Exact phrases: `'"{query}" latest current'`

- **Smart Prioritization**: Sources are scored and ranked by:
  - Official sources (.gov, .edu, .org): +10 points
  - Major news outlets (Reuters, AP, CNN, NYT, etc.): +8 points
  - Recent date indicators in title: +5 points
  - Recent date indicators in content: +3 points

- **Duplicate Filtering**: Removes duplicate URLs and unreliable social media sources
- **Increased Results**: Fetches up to 10 results (was 5) with extra filtering

### 2. Always-On Web Search (`get_gemini_search_response`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Universal Web Search**: Now performs web search for ALL fact-checking requests, not just those with certain keywords
- **Prioritized Instructions**: Enhanced prompts explicitly tell Gemini to prioritize web search results over training data
- **Integration**: Web search results are included directly in the Gemini prompt with clear instructions

### 3. Strengthened Content Validation (`validate_page_content_with_gemini`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Current Event Detection**: New function `_needs_current_verification()` identifies claims that need recent information
- **Enhanced Validation**: More stringent validation for pages when current information is critical
- **Political Keywords**: Specific detection for political events, elections, campaigns, etc.
- **Status Change Detection**: Identifies claims about appointments, resignations, policy changes

### 4. Improved Prompts and Instructions

**Changes Made:**
- **Explicit Warnings**: Clear instructions that training data may be outdated
- **Priority Directives**: Explicit instructions to prioritize web search results
- **Current Date Context**: Enhanced emphasis on 2025 as the current year
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear guidance on how to handle conflicts between sources

## Technical Improvements

### Detection Keywords Added:
- **Time indicators**: 2024, 2025, recent, latest, just, new, current, breaking
- **Political/election**: mayor, election, primary, candidate, running for, campaign, elected, won, victory
- **Government/policy**: bill, law, policy, administration, congress, passed, legislation
- **Status changes**: is now, has become, appointed, resigned, announced, confirmed

### Search Query Strategies:
1. **Temporal Search**: Focuses on recent years (2024-2025)
2. **Authority Search**: Targets official government and institutional sources
3. **News Search**: Gets current news coverage
4. **Exact Phrase Search**: Finds specific mentions with recency indicators

### Validation Improvements:
- Stricter requirements for pages containing recent event claims
- Enhanced detection of outdated information
- Better filtering of irrelevant or broken sources
- Priority scoring system for source reliability

## Expected Results

### Immediate Improvements:
1. **Current Information**: System will now get real-time information for political events, elections, and recent developments
2. **Better Sources**: Prioritizes official sources and recent news over potentially outdated information
3. **Accurate Status**: Will correctly identify current political candidacies, election results, and recent appointments
4. **Reduced Errors**: Fewer notes based on outdated knowledge cutoff information

### Long-term Benefits:
1. **Future-Proof**: System will automatically handle future events and developments
2. **General Application**: Fixes apply to all types of current events, not just politics
3. **Quality Assurance**: Better source verification and validation processes
4. **User Trust**: More accurate fact-checking reduces user frustration with outdated information

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Recent Events**: Try the Zohran Mamdani case again to verify it gets current information
2. **Test with Elections**: Try other recent political developments
3. **Test with Policy Changes**: Try recent legislation or government appointments
4. **Monitor Source Quality**: Check that the priority scoring is working as expected

## Configuration Options

The system now includes several configurable parameters:
- `max_results` in web search (default: 10)
- Priority scoring weights for different source types
- Keyword lists for current event detection
- Temperature settings for different validation stages

This comprehensive fix addresses the core issue of information staleness while maintaining the system's fact-checking capabilities and improving overall accuracy for recent events.
