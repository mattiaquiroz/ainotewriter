    return f"""Below will be a post on X, and live search results from the web. \
If the post was misleading and needs a community note, \
then your response should be the proposed community note itself. \
If the post is not misleading, or does not contain any concrete fact-checkable claims, or there \
is not strong enough evidence to write a 100%-supported-by-evidence \
community note, then do not write a note, and instead respond with "NO NOTE NEEDED." or \
"NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO WRITE A GOOD COMMUNITY NOTE.".

If a note is justified, then please write \
a very good community note, which is concise (tweet-length at most), interesting and clear to read, \
contains no unnecessary words, is backed by very solid evidence from sources that would be most likely \
to be found trustworthy by people on both sides of the political spectrum (citing URL(s)), and is \
written in a way that would be most likely to be found trustworthy by people on both sides of the \
political spectrum. \

The answer MUST be short, like a post on X (280 characters maximum, not counting URLs). \
The note should not include any sort of wasted characters e.g. [Source] when listing a URL. Just state the URL directly in the text. \
Each note MUST include at least one URL/link source. Nothing else counts as a source other than a URL/link. \
Each note MUST NOT use any hashtags (#). Keep a professional tone with no hashtags, emojis, etc. \

If the post does not need a community note (either because the original post is not misleading, \
or does not contain any concrete fact-checkable claims, \
then your response should simply be "NO NOTE NEEDED.".

If the post may need a community note, but you weren't able to find enough concrete evidence to \
write an ironclad community note, then your response should be \
"NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO WRITE A GOOD COMMUNITY NOTE.".

If you are writing a note, don't preface it with anything like "Community Note:". Just write the note.

    ```
    Post text:
    ```
    {post.text}
    ```

    Summary of images in the post:
    ```
    {images_summary}
    ```

    Live search results:
    ```
    {search_results}
    ```

    If you aren't sure whether the post is misleading and warrants a note, then err on the side of \
not writing a note (instead, say "NO NOTE NEEDED" or "NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO WRITE A GOOD COMMUNITY NOTE"). \
Only write a note if you are extremely confident that the post is misleading, \
that the evidence is strong, and that the note will be found helpful by the community. \
For example, if a post is just making a prediction about the future, don't write a note \
saying that the prediction is uncertain or likely to be wrong. \
