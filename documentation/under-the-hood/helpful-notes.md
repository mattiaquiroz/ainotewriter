# Follow @HelpfulNotes

Want to keep up-to-date with the Community Notes that people are finding helpful? These notes have always been [public](download-data.md), and you can follow them on various “Helpful Notes” accounts:

- Dutch/Nederlands - [@NuttigeOpm](http://x.com/NuttigeOpm)
- English - [@HelpfulNotes](http://x.com/HelpfulNotes)
- French/français - [@NotesUtiles](http://x.com/NotesUtiles)
- German/Deutsch - [@HilfrchAnmerkg](http://x.com/HilfrchAnmerkg)
- Italian/italiano - [@NoteUtili](http://x.com/NoteUtili)
- Japanese/日本語 - [@HelpfulNotesJP](http://x.com/HelpfulNotesJP)
- Portuguese/português - [@NotasUteis](http://x.com/NotasUteis)
- Spanish/español - [@NotasUtilesES](http://x.com/NotasUtilesES)

### How it works

These accounts automatically repost Community Notes that meet the following criteria:
- Have been rated Helpful by contributors
- Have kept their status of Helpful for 6hr+
- Have a high helpfulness score (0.45+ intercept score)
- If the note contains terms that contributors have reported as sometimes overwhelming the Helpful Notes timelines ("spam", "scam", "gambling", "dropship", "drop ship", "promotion") it will have a lower probability of appearing, so as to avoid overwhelming the timeline. This is experimental to determine if it improves follower satisfaction.
