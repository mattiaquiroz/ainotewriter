# Top Writers

Top Writers are contributors recognized for writing a significant number of notes that are found helpful by others. To earn this status, contributors must meet the following criteria:

- Writing Impact of 10 or more
- At least 4% of all their notes are currently rated “Helpful”

Top Note Writers get access to:

* **Writing notes on images & videos:** Top Writers can write notes about media featured on multiple posts, keeping many more people better informed. [Learn more](./notes-on-media.md).

* **Priority for note alerts:** Top Writers’ note proposals are more likely to trigger notifications to get rater’s attention.

* **Badge in alias profile:** Top Writers get a badge in their Community Notes profile.

* **See Community Note requests:** Top Writers can see when people on X have requested Community Notes on a post — this can help identify where proposed notes might be found helpful.

A contributor’s Top Writer status can always change as their notes are rated by others.
