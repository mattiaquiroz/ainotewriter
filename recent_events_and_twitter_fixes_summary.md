# Recent Events and Twitter Fixes Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Outdated Information for Recent Events** ✅
**Issue**: The AI model's knowledge cutoff caused it to incorrectly claim that recent events (like the "Big Beautiful Bill" passing on July 3, 2025) didn't happen.

**Root Cause**: 
- Gemini's training data has a cutoff that doesn't include very recent events from 2025
- The system wasn't specifically designed to handle uncertainty about recent events
- No web search capabilities to supplement outdated knowledge

**Solution Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced Search Prompts for Recent Events
**File**: `src/note_writer/write_note.py` - `_get_prompt_for_live_search()`
```
- Added explicit current date context: "Today is 2025"
- Special instructions for 2024-2025 events to prioritize recent sources
- Instructions to search extensively for recent political events, bills, legislation
- Awareness that AI knowledge may be outdated for very recent events
```

#### B. Improved Note Writing Awareness
**File**: `src/note_writer/write_note.py` - `_get_prompt_for_note_writing()`
```
- Added "SPECIAL WARNINGS FOR RECENT EVENTS (2024-2025)" section
- Instructions to be extremely cautious about recent legislation claims
- Humility about training data limitations for very recent events
- Guidance to lean toward "NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE" when uncertain about recent events
```

#### C. Web Search Integration for Recent Events
**File**: `src/note_writer/llm_util.py` - New functions:
```python
def search_web_for_recent_info(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> str:
    """Search web for recent information using DuckDuckGo"""

def get_gemini_search_response(prompt: str, temperature: float = 0.8):
    """Enhanced with web search for recent events"""
```

Features:
- Automatically detects recent event keywords (2024, 2025, "just passed", "new bill", etc.)
- Performs supplemental web search using DuckDuckGo
- Filters out unreliable social media sources
- Combines Gemini response with current web search results

### 2. **Eliminated/Deleted Twitter/X Posts as Sources** ✅
**Issue**: The system was incorrectly using deleted or eliminated Twitter/X posts as valid sources for fact-checking.

**Root Cause**:
- No specific detection for Twitter/X URLs that return error pages
- Missing validation for common "tweet deleted" or "account suspended" messages
- General URL validation wasn't specific enough for social media platforms

**Solution Implemented**:

#### Enhanced Twitter/X URL Validation
**File**: `src/note_writer/llm_util.py` - `validate_page_content_with_gemini()`

Added pre-validation for Twitter/X URLs:
```python
# Check if this is a Twitter/X URL that might be deleted/eliminated
parsed_url = urlparse(url.lower())
is_twitter_url = parsed_url.netloc in ['twitter.com', 'x.com', 'www.twitter.com', 'www.x.com', 'mobile.twitter.com', 'm.twitter.com']

# Check for common indicators of deleted/eliminated Twitter posts
if is_twitter_url:
    deleted_indicators = [
        "this post is from a suspended account",
        "this post has been deleted",
        "this tweet is unavailable", 
        "this account owner limits who can view",
        "tweet not found",
        "post not found",
        "account suspended",
        "page doesn't exist",
        "something went wrong",
        "try again",
        "hmm...this page doesn't exist",
        "sorry, you are not authorized to see this status",
        "this tweet was deleted"
    ]
```

#### Updated Validation Instructions
Enhanced the Gemini validation prompt to specifically check for:
- Deleted/eliminated social media posts
- Twitter/X specific error messages
- "Tweet not found", "Account suspended" messages

#### Search Prompt Improvements
**File**: `src/note_writer/write_note.py`
- Added "AVOID Twitter/X links as primary sources - prefer mainstream news or official sources"
- Explicit instruction to "REJECT any eliminated/deleted Twitter/X posts as sources"

## Dependencies Added

**File**: `pyproject.toml`
```
"duckduckgo-search>=6.3.0"
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### For Recent Events:
1. **Enhanced Awareness**: System now knows it's operating in 2025 and recent events may not be in training data
2. **Web Search Supplement**: Recent event claims trigger additional web search for current information
3. **Humble Uncertainty**: When evidence is conflicting or insufficient for recent events, defaults to "NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE"
4. **Current Source Prioritization**: Actively seeks the most recent sources for 2024-2025 events

### For Twitter/X Sources:
1. **Deleted Post Detection**: Automatically detects and rejects eliminated/deleted Twitter posts
2. **Social Media Filtering**: Prefers mainstream news and official sources over social media
3. **Error Message Recognition**: Recognizes common Twitter error messages and account suspension notices
4. **Better Source Quality**: Focus on reputable news outlets and government sources rather than social media

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Recent Events**: Test with claims about recent political events, bills, or legislation from 2024-2025
2. **Deleted Tweets**: Test with known deleted or suspended Twitter account URLs
3. **Current Events**: Verify the web search integration works for breaking news
4. **Source Quality**: Confirm that notes prioritize official sources over social media

## Key Files Modified

- ✅ `src/note_writer/write_note.py` - Enhanced prompts for recent events
- ✅ `src/note_writer/llm_util.py` - Added web search and Twitter validation
- ✅ `pyproject.toml` - Added duckduckgo-search dependency

The system should now be much more reliable for recent events and will avoid using eliminated social media posts as sources.
