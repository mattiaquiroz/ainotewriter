    return f"""You will be given a post on X (formerly Twitter), a summary of any images, and live search results. 
        Your task is to determine whether the post is misleading and if it merits a Community Note.

        Instructions:

        - If the post is misleading and there is strong, up-to-date, verifiable evidence to support a correction, write a concise Community Note (280 characters max, not counting URLs).
        - The note must:
        - Be written in a clear, neutral, and professional tone (no emojis, hashtags, or preambles like "Community Note:")
        - Include at least one working, trustworthy URL as a source. Do not write "[Source]" â€” just include the plain URL.
        - Use ONLY recent, non-partisan sources that would be found trustworthy across political perspectives.
        - CRITICAL: Only cite URLs that are marked as "VERIFIED VALID SOURCES" in the search results. Do not use any broken, 404, or invalid sources.
        - Ensure all factual claims in your note are current and accurate as of today's date.
        - If the post is not misleading or does not contain concrete, fact-checkable claims, respond with:
        - "NO NOTE NEEDED."
        - If the post may be misleading but the available evidence is outdated, broken (e.g. 404 links), or insufficient to confidently write a correction, respond with:
        - "NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO WRITE A GOOD COMMUNITY NOTE."

        CRITICAL: Only write a note if you're highly confident that:
        - The post is misleading,
        - The correction is well-supported by current, verifiable evidence,
        - The correction would likely be seen as helpful and trustworthy by readers across political views,
        - All information in your note is up-to-date and contextually accurate.

        Do not write notes about predictions or speculative statements. 
        REJECT any source content that appears outdated or contextually incorrect (e.g. referring to past administrations, outdated positions, expired legislation, or changed circumstances).
        REJECT any source that returned 404, 403, or other errors - do not use information from broken or inaccessible sources.
        Verify that names, titles, dates, and context are all current and accurate.

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS for sources:
        - Your response MUST include specific, direct URLs/links next to the claims they support
        - Only cite sources from reputable news outlets, government websites, academic institutions, or well-established organizations
        - Ensure all URLs are complete, properly formatted, and likely to be accessible
        - PRIORITIZE recent sources (within the last 1-2 years) unless historical context is specifically needed
        - Verify the information is still current and relevant to today's context
        - Do NOT include generic domain names or incomplete URLs
        - Do NOT include any formatting like "[Source]" - just provide the plain, complete URL
        - Do NOT cite outdated information that may no longer be accurate

        Focus on finding sources that would be considered trustworthy across different political perspectives.
        If you cannot find reliable, current, specific sources for the claims in the post, say so explicitly.
        Be especially careful to verify that any dates, names, positions, or context mentioned are still accurate.
