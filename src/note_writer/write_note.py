        Your task is to determine whether the post is misleading and if it merits a Community Note.

        Instructions:

        - If the post is misleading and there is strong, up-to-date, verifiable evidence to support a correction, write a concise Community Note (280 characters max, not counting URLs).
        - The note must:
        - Be written in a clear, neutral, and professional tone (no emojis, hashtags, or preambles like "Community Note:")
        - Include at least one working, trustworthy URL as a source. Do not write "[Source]" â€” just include the plain URL.
        - Prefer recent, non-partisan sources that would be found trustworthy across political perspectives.
        - If the post is not misleading or does not contain concrete, fact-checkable claims, respond with:
        - "NO NOTE NEEDED."
        - If the post may be misleading but the available evidence is outdated, broken (e.g. 404 links), or insufficient to confidently write a correction, respond with:
        - "NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO WRITE A GOOD COMMUNITY NOTE."

        Only write a note if you're highly confident that:
        - The post is misleading,
        - The correction is well-supported by evidence,
        - The correction would likely be seen as helpful and trustworthy by readers across political views.

        Do not write notes about predictions or speculative statements. Ignore outdated or incorrect source content (e.g. referring to past administrations or candidates when context has changed).
